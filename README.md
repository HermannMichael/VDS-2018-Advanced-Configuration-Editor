This Visual Studio project is an updated version of the 2017 Advanced Editor, introduced to Autodesk EMEA reseller channel @OTX 2016, Berlin. 
Basically the project has all VDS 2018 configuration files linked from ProgramData's Extension folder. 
So each edit is immediatly reflects in current running Vault or CAD sessions. 
The advanced configuration editor additionally shares all snippets and templates that might help to quickly reuse functions.

This Editor is my active tool. Simply subscribe to stay up to date as I am adding all stuff, that I intend to reuse. 
The Master configuration 2018.0 has linked all configuration files delivered by VDS 2018 RTM installation. Other branches might appear
to switch configurations with additional configuration files, e.g. Quickstart configuration. But note - the physical files of other 
configurations are never included in these branches, but linked only. To get full configurations watch out my repository for VLT-MKDE 
(my demo environment, based on a specific Vault configuration) or the VDS Quickstart Configurations, that are compatible to each Vault 
based on Autodesk Vault Manufacturing CFG templates.
